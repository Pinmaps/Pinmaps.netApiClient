<h2>About</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.pinmaps.net/">Pinmaps.net</a> is an online service that lets individuals easily search, save, share 
and quickly access their favorite locations on a map.<br /> 
Pinmaps.net allows you to create maps where you can add map points (push pins) to it.<br /> 
What makes this service stand out from other services is that you can save each map point with its own zoom level 
and map type.<br /> 
We suggest that you get familiar with the <a href="http://www.pinmaps.net/">Pinmaps.net service</a> and understand the concepts behing it before attempting to use the API.

<h2>What you need</h2>
<p>
In order to interact with the Pinmaps API you need to get a developer's API key and a user's API key. Every single 
call to the API requires four main credentials:
DeveloperApiLogin, DeveloperApiKey, Username, and UserApiKey.
</p>

Obtaining these four API Credentials is a three step process:
<ul>
  <li>You have to <a href="http://www.pinmaps.net/Login/CreateUser.aspx">signup for the Pinmaps.net service</a> </li>
  <li>You have to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pinmaps.net/Users/DeveloperApi.aspx">register as a Pinmaps.net Developer</a> </li>
  <li>You need to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pinmaps.net/Users/User_ApiKey.aspx"> obtain your user's API key</a> </li>
</ul>
Your Developer's API key will allow you to interact with your own pinmaps account as well as to make calls to the Pinmaps API on behalf of other users. If you want to make API calls on behalf of other users you need to ask them for their user's API key.
